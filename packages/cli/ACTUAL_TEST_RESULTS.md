# Actual Test Results - Framework Validation

## Date: 2025-08-19

## Critical Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. ❌ CRITICAL: Dependencies Not Installing with --install Flag

**Problem**: The `--install` flag was not actually installing dependencies. The CLI showed "Dependencies installed successfully" but `node_modules` was empty.

**Root Cause**: In `src/commands/init.ts`, the code was calling `installDependencies([])` with an empty array. The `installDependencies` function returns immediately if the array is empty (line 141 in package-manager.ts).

**Fix Applied**: Changed from `installDependencies([])` to `installAllDependencies()` which properly installs all dependencies from package.json.

```typescript
// Before (BROKEN):
const installPromise = installDependencies([], {
  packageManager: config.packageManager,
  projectPath,
  dev: false,
});

// After (FIXED):
const installPromise = installAllDependencies({
  packageManager: config.packageManager,
  projectPath,
  generate: config.generate,
});
```

### 2. ⚠️ React Hero Component - useEffect Dependency Warning

**Problem**: ESLint warning about missing dependency in useEffect hook

```
React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: 'fullText'
```

**Fix Applied**: Added `fullText` to the dependency array in `Hero.tsx.hbs`:

```typescript
// Before:
}, []);

// After:
}, [fullText]);
```

### 3. ✅ Counter-css.tsx JSX Attribute (False Positive)

**Problem**: TypeScript error about `jsx: true` property not existing
**Resolution**: This error only occurred when dependencies weren't installed. Once dependencies were properly installed, the error disappeared (styled-jsx types were available).

## Real Test Results After Fixes

| Framework | Dependencies Install | Type-Check | ESLint               | Build     |
| --------- | -------------------- | ---------- | -------------------- | --------- |
| React     | ✅ Fixed             | ✅ Passes  | ⚠️ 1 Warning (fixed) | ✅ Passes |
| Next.js   | ✅ Fixed             | ✅ Passes  | ✅ Passes            | ✅ Passes |
| Vue       | ✅ Fixed             | ✅ Passes  | N/A                  | ✅ Passes |
| Svelte    | ✅ Fixed             | ✅ Passes  | N/A                  | ✅ Passes |
| Vite      | ✅ Fixed             | ✅ Passes  | N/A                  | ✅ Passes |

## Summary of Fixes

1. **Fixed installation bug** - Changed `installDependencies([])` to `installAllDependencies()`
2. **Fixed React useEffect warning** - Added missing dependency to array
3. **ESLint configuration** - Already fixed with `ESLINT_USE_FLAT_CONFIG=false`
4. **Vue template paths** - Already fixed in previous session
5. **Removed unsupported powerups** - Already removed angular-localize, solid-i18n, solid-router

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Test project creation with installation
./dist/cli.js init test-project --framework next --install --yes

# Verify dependencies installed
ls -la test-project/node_modules

# Run type-check
cd test-project && bun run type-check

# Run lint
cd test-project && bun run lint

# Run build
cd test-project && bun run build
```

## Key Findings

1. **The --install flag was completely broken** - Projects were created without any dependencies installed
2. **All "successful" test results were false positives** - Tests appeared to pass because dependencies weren't being checked
3. **TypeScript errors only showed up after fixing installation** - Without node_modules, type checking couldn't run properly

## Status

✅ **ALL CRITICAL ISSUES FIXED**

The CLI now:

- Properly installs dependencies with --install flag
- Generates valid TypeScript/JavaScript code
- Passes all linting checks (after fixes)
- Successfully builds all supported frameworks
