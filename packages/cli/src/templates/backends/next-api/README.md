# Next.js API Routes

Next.js API routes are integrated into the Next.js framework itself and don't require separate backend templates.

When you select `next-api` as your backend, the API routes are created within your Next.js application in the `app/api` or `pages/api` directory (depending on whether you're using App Router or Pages Router).

This directory exists only as a placeholder to maintain consistency in the template structure.
